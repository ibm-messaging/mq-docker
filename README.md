# Overview

Run [IBMÂ® MQ](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-mq) in a Docker container.  By default, the supplied Dockerfile runs [IBM MQ for Developers](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-mq-advanced-for-developers), but also works for IBM MQ.  The source can be found on the [ibm-messaging GitHub](http://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-docker).  There's also a short [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoomAVqk0cI) available.

# Docker Hub
The image is available on Docker Hub as [`ibmcom/mq`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/mq/) with the following tags:

  * `9`, `latest` ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-docker/blob/master/server/Dockerfile))
  * `8` ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-docker/blob/master/server/Dockerfile-mq8))

# Preparing your Docker host
You need to make sure that you either have a Linux kernel version of V3.16, or else you need to add the [`--ipc host`](http://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#ipc-settings) option when you run an MQ container.  The reason for this is that IBM MQ uses shared memory, and on Linux kernels prior to V3.16, containers are usually limited to 32 MB of shared memory.  In a [change](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/mhocko/mm.git/commit/include/uapi/linux/shm.h?id=060028bac94bf60a65415d1d55a359c3a17d5c31
) to Linux kernel V3.16, the hard-coded limit is greatly increased.  This kernel version is available in Ubuntu 14.04.2 onwards, Fedora V20 onwards, and boot2docker V1.2 onwards.  If you are using a host with an older kernel version, but Docker version 1.4 or newer, then you can still run MQ, but you have to give it access to the host's IPC namespace using the [`--ipc host`](http://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#ipc-settings) option on `docker run`.  Note that this reduces the security isolation of your container.  Using the host's IPC namespace is a temporary workaround, and you should not attempt shared-memory connections to queue managers from outside the container.

# Build
After extracting the code from this repository, you can build an image with the latest version of MQ using the following command:

```
sudo docker build --tag mq ./server/
```

To build alternative versions, you can use commands similar to the following:

```
sudo docker build --tag mq:8 --file ./server/Dockerfile-mq8 ./server/
```

# Usage
In order to use the image, it is necessary to accept the terms of the IBM MQ license.  This is achieved by specifying the environment variable `LICENSE` equal to `accept` when running the image.  You can also view the license terms by setting this variable to `view`. Failure to set the variable will result in the termination of the container with a usage statement.  You can view the license in a different language by also setting the `LANG` environment variable.

This image is primarily intended to be used as an example base image for your own MQ images.

## Running with the default configuration
You can run a queue manager with the default configuration and a listener on port 1414 using the following command.  Note that the default configuration is locked-down from a security perspective, so you will need to customize the configuration in order to effectively use the queue manager.  For example, the following command creates and starts a queue manager called `QM1`, and maps port 1414 on the host to the MQ listener on port 1414 inside the container:

```
sudo docker run \
  --env LICENSE=accept \
  --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 \
  --volume /var/example/qmgrs:/var/mqm/qmgrs \
  --volume /var/example/log:/var/mqm/log \
  --volume /var/example/errors:/var/mqm/errors \
  --volume /var/example/trace:/var/mqm/trace \
  --publish 1414:1414 \
  --detach \
  mq
```

Note that in this example, the name "mq" is the image tag you used in the previous build step.

Also note that the filesystem for each mounted volume directory (`/var/example` in the above example) must be [supported](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pla.doc/q005820_.htm?lang=en).

## Customizing the queue manager configuration
You can customize the configuration in several ways:

1. By creating your own image and adding your an MQSC file called `/etc/mqm/config.mqsc`.  This file will be run when your queue manager is created.
2. By using [remote MQ administration](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q021090_.htm).  Note that this will require additional configuration as remote administration is not enabled by default.

Note that a listener is always created on port 1414 inside the container.  This port can be mapped to any port on the Docker host.

The following is an *example* `Dockerfile` for creating your own pre-configured image, which adds a custom `config.mqsc` and an administrative user `alice`.  Note that it is not normally recommended to include passwords in this way:

```dockerfile
FROM mq
RUN useradd alice -G mqm && \
    echo alice:passw0rd | chpasswd
COPY config.mqsc /etc/mqm/
```

Here is an example corresponding `config.mqsc` script from the [mqdev blog](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/messaging/entry/getting_going_without_turning_off_mq_security?lang=en), which allows users with passwords to connect on the `PASSWORD.SVRCONN` channel:

```
DEFINE CHANNEL(PASSWORD.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)
SET CHLAUTH(PASSWORD.SVRCONN) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody') DESCR('Allow privileged users on this channel')
SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(NOACCESS) DESCR('BackStop rule')
SET CHLAUTH(PASSWORD.SVRCONN) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(CHANNEL) CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED)
ALTER AUTHINFO(SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS) AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) ADOPTCTX(YES)
REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(CONNAUTH)
```

## Running MQ commands
It is recommended that you configure MQ in your own custom image.  However, you may need to run MQ commands directly inside the process space of the container.  To run a command against a running queue manager, you can use `docker exec`, for example:

```
sudo docker exec \
  --tty \
  --interactive \
  ${CONTAINER_ID} \
  dspmq
```

Using this technique, you can have full control over all aspects of the MQ installation.  Note that if you use this technique to make changes to the filesystem, then those changes would be lost if you re-created your container unless you make those changes in volumes.


## Installed components

This image includes the core MQ server, Java, language packs, and GSKit.  Other features (except the client) are not currently supported running in Docker.  See the [MQ documentation](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ins.doc/q008350_.htm) for details of which RPMs to choose.

# Troubleshooting

## Container command not found or does not exist
This message also appears as "System error: no such file or directory" in some versions of Docker.  This can happen using Docker Toolbox on Windows, and is related to line-ending characters.  When you clone the Git repository on Windows, Git is often configured to convert any UNIX-style LF line-endings to Windows-style CRLF line-endings.  Files with these line-endings end up in the built Docker image, and cause the container to fail at start-up.  One solution to this problem is to stop Git from converting the line-ending characters, with the following command:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

## AMQ7017: Log not available
If you see this message in the container logs, it means that the directory being used for the container's volume doesn't use a filesystem supported by IBM MQ.  This often happens when using Docker Toolbox or boot2docker, which use `tmpfs` for the `/var` directory.  To solve this, you need to make sure the container's `/var/mqm` volume is put on a supported filesystem.  For example, with Docker Toolbox try using a directory under `/mnt/sda1`.  You can list filesystem types using the command `df -T`
