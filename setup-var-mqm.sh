# First we check whether the directory /var/mqm exists. If it does, we do nothing
# Then we check whether /var/mqm is a symlink. If it is we don't do anything
# If /var/mqm does not exist then we try to find the default Bluemix mount and
# mount it. Otherwise we give up and just create /var/mqm

# WARNING: This step will migrate data ownership, so should be used with caution.
# Migrate from older versions of this sample, which used UID/GID 1000 as mqm.
# This was updated to UID/GID 999, to be from the "system" pool of users, so less likely to
# clash with a real user on the host.
